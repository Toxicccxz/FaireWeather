# FaireWeather

The weather API in the doc seems corrupt, I couldn't find any information about 'current weather', only bunch of historical data, so I used an open weather api:
-------    https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3 
it has current weather information and also some other details, I use my spare time in two days (around 2 hours per day maybe) in this weekend to finish it. Sorry I have babies to take care of so couldn't finish it in one day.


The app allow users to search for a valid location using a city name.
Show the current weather and a 5-day forecast
Ability to sort the forecast by date desc or asc.
